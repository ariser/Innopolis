Hi Bruce, (Dear Mr Roberts,)

Thanks for reaching out. I've read your suggestions through and I think I have some comments on them.

First of all, I really like your idea regarding the second sauna. We should definitely write it down for the future.
However, you should know that we are receiving complaints from our customers regarding small swimming pool changing
room. I think it would be wiser to extend it, creating an opportunity for a larger flow of customers, as this is
obviously a popular service.

Secondly, the extra equipment. I see your point here. However, the thing about it is that it definitely will require
a lot of space, which we are lacking. Along with that, I believe that right now we should concentrate on extensive
development. We already have a solid set of equipment, and it does just fine. I am sure that if we had more variety
of services we can provide to our customers, it would make a great deal of profit for us. We can hire more
instructors and open new classes.

Finally, the snack bar. What you're suggesting sounds interesting, but expensive. I'm afraid we can't afford buying
a wide screeen TV at the moment. Again, it's pretty crowdy at the snack bar even now, so it seems like we don't need
additional attractions. On the other hand, I'd suggest buying some extra cooking facilities, a new microwave in particular.
I've been there in a rush hour, and it taking way too long to get to the only microwave we have right now.

There it is. I hope you will see my point. Please write me back if you want to discuss these ideas more.
Waiting to hear from you.

Best regards,
me
