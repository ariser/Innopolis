Ex. 2.2
a. 'Cos -> because
b. Shi'ite -> shia (according to the Wikipedia article, "Shi'ite", "Shiite" and "Shia" all describe followers of Shiism)
c. cont'd -> continued
d. Hawai'i -> hawaii
e. O'Rourke -> orourke (not sure here, but I think that irish family names could be safely normalized to a non-apostrophe form)

Ex. 2.4
a. The next step removes single S'es, so we have to make sure that double S'es don't get removed, or at least it should work like that
b.
circus -> circu
canaries -> canari
boss -> boss
c. Y -> I
d. There is no deleterious effect, because transformations take place internally, with no restrictinos imposed upon input from either side, either from a user or from documents content. A search for "pony" will result in searching "poni" among tokens where all forms of "pony" were also transformed into "poni".

Ex. 2.7
a. Once, at 24 from the first postings list.
regarding b and c - i'm not sure what counts as "a posting comparsion" in this task. Do comparsion of a posting with a skip pointer counts as a posting comparsion? Do equality check and lt (less-than) check in a single iteration count as one comparsion, or as two? Depending on that, the answer could be:
b - 16, c - 19 (skips don't count, equality and lt is a single comparsion)
b - 27, c - 33 (skips don't count, equality and lt is two comparsions)
b - 29, c - 33 (skips count, equality and lt is a single comparsion)
b - 40, c - 33 (skips count, equality and lt is two comparsions)
